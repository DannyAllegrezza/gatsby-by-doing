Hello world. Welcome to my personal space on the Internet. My name is Danny Allegrezza and I am a software engineer living in Cary, North Carolina. I'll be using this space to blog about cars, code, cats, and occasionally my personal life. 

This is a new iteration of my website, so I'll be slowly back-filling in this blog with back-dated posts.
